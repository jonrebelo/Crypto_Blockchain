# Cryptocurrency Blockchain

This project is a cryptocurrency blockchain, similar to Bitcoin, implemented using the SHA256 algorithm. 

## Features

- **SHA256 Algorithm**: The blockchain uses the SHA256 algorithm for hashing.
- **Proof of Work (PoW) Mining**: The blockchain implements a PoW algorithm for mining new blocks.
- **Public Nodes**: The network consists of public nodes that participate in the blockchain.
- **Flask User Interface**: A Flask application is used as a user interface for sending and receiving transactions.
